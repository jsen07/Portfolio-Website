# Portfolio-Website

In week 2 of the UOB Coding Bootcamp we were given the assignemnt to build the first version of our portfolio website. The portfolio would contain different sections as a projects, about me, contact and a hero section. This portfolio website is a way for me to show off my skills in web developmentn and will be used in the future for future employers to look at  the projects which i have done and to see what i am like as a person and reach out to me if they are interested in working with me. 

As it was my first time creating a website portfolio, i have done some research and looked at other website portfilios which other people have made to gain insipiration, and have conducted this research through the website pinterest. The website portfolio itself is written in HTML and CSS, HTML to create elements onto the screen and CSS to stylise those elements. In developing this portfolio website i had struggled with placing certain elements on the screen and have had to research on different ways in order to achieve the placement of the items that i want, through this process i have gained a better understanding of how to use the CSS Flexbox layout and have gained more familiar in using it for future practices. Another challenge which i have faced is through writing redundant code, such as when i was utilizing media queries. When usinbg media queries i would find myseld repeating code that wouldn't change the website, and to fix this i focused on only changing pieces of code of certain elements on the screen only when they would break at a certain browser screen size.  

In the future, i wish to add more stylization to my portfolio website, and to add more effects such as hover, transition and animation effects, to achieve this i will need to familiarise myself more on how to use CSS. In addition, i would also like to add javascript to my website which i can use to create a form and use data from the form in ways such as allowing the user to send me an email through the portfolio website.

The website portfolio can be run through this link (https://jsen07.github.io/Portfolio-Website/) When on the website the navigation bar will help scroll you to the different sections of the webpage. In the project section, if you click on the projects it will take you to the deployed website of the project.
